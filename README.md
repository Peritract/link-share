# Link Sharing

This project is a small link-sharing server (with a planned front-end in the future).

Users can post new links, as well as see a list of all links. Links can be voted on, or deleted entirely.

## Installation

- Move into `server/`
- Run `npm install -D`

## Development

Run `npm run dev` from inside the `server/` folder
